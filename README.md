# QuickCheck
## Efficient student check-in/out web app for schools, enhancing safety and convenience for parents and teachers.

Our Student Check-In/Out Web Application is designed to streamline the process of tracking students' attendance at school, providing a convenient solution for both teachers and parents. With this application, teachers can easily manage student attendance, access parent contact information, and maintain an overview of who is present in the school at any given time. Parents can also utilize the system to check their child in or out remotely, ensuring a smooth and efficient process for pick-ups and drop-offs.

## A school project
The system was conceived during our 4th semester of Computer Science as part of a school project. Throughout the development process, we maintained excellent communication with our client, ensuring the incorporation of requested features while also leveraging our expertise to suggest additional functionalities. It's important to note that the final product is a prototype and not intended for production deployment.

## The Tech-Stack
For the project, our tech-stack choices were limited due to it being a school project. The front end was developed using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while the backend utilized an Express.js server coupled with a Firebase database. Additionally, we employed Git and GitHub for version control, with GitHub Projects serving as our Scrum Board for project management.
